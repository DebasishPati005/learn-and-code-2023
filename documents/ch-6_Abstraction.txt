Access Control:
Involves controlling the access to the internal state of an object.
Getters and setters are part of this control.

Behaviour Abstraction:
In addition to managing data, abstraction involves abstracting the behavior of an object. 
This includes defining methods that represent the actions.


Reducing Complexity:
Abstraction aims to simplify the understanding and usage of a class by hiding unnecessary details.



SUMMARY
while getters and setters are a part of data abstraction, the concept goes beyond mere variable access.
It involves organizing and presenting the internal details of a class in a way
that promotes clarity, encapsulation, and controlled interaction with external code.
Essential features of an object and providing a well-defined interface for working with those features.
